# Airline-Timeliness Analysis 
## Description
This project aims to evaluate and analyze flight delay patterns and on-time performance for various airlines. The analysis will be broken down into three key areas: on-time performance, delay patterns, and the impact of airports and routes on flight delays.  Key questions addressed in this report include:
+ On-Time Performance: What percentage of flights that are on time for each airline?
+ Comparison of Delay Causes and Number of Delayed Flights by Airline: How do the causes of delays and the number of delayed flights differ across each airline?
+ Airport and Route Impact: Are delays linked to specific airport or hub?
